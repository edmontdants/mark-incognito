## Inspiration ?

The inspiration for this came from a twitter thread, started by @getify which was regarding a browser functionality which will allow you to mark websites to always open incognito mode.


## Current Feature Set ?

- Mark as incognito is an option in the right click menu on links as well as can be done for the current domain from the extension icon in the browser menu tab.

- Browser extension has a list of all marked domains, with easy remove list option.

## Documentation

The documentation is automatically generated by [jsdoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc). Follow the guidelines outlined for jsdoc when adding documentation to new or existing methods.

### Usage

```
yarn jsdoc
```

This will generate a `out` directory containing the documentation. To test locally, make sure you've generated the documentation at least once and that you have [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) installed. Run the following command.

```
npx serve out
```

This will start a local server and provide you with a local address.
